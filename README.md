The main challenge was to build this website “Expedia” without using any library,
so accordingly we have designed this website.
We made dynamic pages for displaying hotels descriptions,
Show-hotel page, and payment page using javascript (DOM, local storage).
We also designed the signup and sign-in page,
In that page all the details of the sign-up page will be stored in the local storage.
when I fill the form there is a password and confirm password are there if the password and confirm password are not the same then
alert “Password and confirm password is not same”.
On the login page,
all the details will be fetched from the local storage.
After filling in only the correct details on the login page,
we can be able to proceed further to the Home page,
or else we can not be able to go to the home page.
after going homepage when I click the search button. 
the page will go to the hotel’s page where all hotels list is there all data are taken from DOM. 
after showing all data we can select one and do to show_hotel page.
their data will come from local storage and after clicking reserve go to the payment page and where to submit all payment details and after submitting all detail and click
it will show alert “payment done booking confirmed”. 
we ho to again home page so that’s all about our Project. 
Thank You.
